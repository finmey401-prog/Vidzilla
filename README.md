## Webhook Setup

For production, you need to set up a webhook. The bot supports ngrok for development:

   ```
   ngrok http 8000
   ```

2. Copy the ngrok URL and set it as your `WEBHOOK_URL` in the `.env` file.

## Dependencies

The project uses the following main dependencies:

- `aiogram` - Modern and fully asynchronous framework for Telegram Bot API
- `aiohttp` - Asynchronous HTTP client/server framework
- `python-dotenv` - Environment variable management
- `pymongo` - MongoDB driver
- `requests` - HTTP requests library
- `instaloader` - Library for downloading content from Instagram
- `stripe` - Stripe API client for payments
- `asyncio` - Asynchronous I/O library

## API Usage

This bot uses two main methods for downloading content:

1. **Instagram**: Uses the Instaloader library for downloading Instagram Reels and Posts
2. **Other platforms**: Uses the "auto-download-all-in-one" API from RapidAPI to fetch videos from TikTok, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest

## Technical Notes

- The bot might show a "403 Forbidden" error when accessing Instagram's GraphQL API. This is normal behavior as Instagram restricts automated access, but the Instaloader library has fallback methods that still allow successful downloads in most cases.
- For other platforms, the API might have rate limits depending on your RapidAPI subscription plan.
- Make sure your MongoDB server is running and accessible before starting the bot.

## User Experience

1. Users start with a limited number of free downloads (default: 3)
2. After reaching the limit, they need to subscribe or use a coupon
3. Videos are sent both as a playable video message and as a downloadable file
4. For Instagram posts that contain images instead of videos, the images are sent as photos

## Stripe Integration

This bot uses Stripe for handling payments. It supports both credit card payments and PayPal.

To set up Stripe for production payments:

1. Create a Stripe account at https://stripe.com if you haven't already.
2. In the Stripe Dashboard, navigate to the API keys section.
3. Copy your live secret key and publishable key.
4. Update your `.env` file with these live keys.
5. Set up a webhook in the Stripe Dashboard pointing to your webhook URL.
6. To enable PayPal, connect your PayPal account in the Stripe Dashboard.
