## AI Assistant Notes
This bot is actively maintained and uses modern Python async/await patterns. The codebase is well-structured with separation of concerns between handlers, utilities, and platform-specific downloaders. When working with this project, pay attention to:
- Async/await patterns throughout the codebase
- MongoDB document structure for users and subscriptions
- Webhook-based deployment architecture
- Platform-specific video extraction logic
- Admin permission checks for sensitive operations
